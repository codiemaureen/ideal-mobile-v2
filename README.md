# 🛍️ Ideal Mobile Detailing (Next.js Rewrite)

> **Status:** 🚧 In Progress — Started on `2025-08-12`  
> This is my ongoing rewrite of a previously built React e-commerce app, rebuilt in Next.js for performance, SEO, and scalability improvements.

- Improved SEO performance
- Cleaner developer experience

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (v15+)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Language:** Javascript
- **Backend:** _(Prisma + PostgreSQL)_
- **Deployment:** Vercel
